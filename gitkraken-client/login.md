You've installed the app; fantastic! Now to login with your account.

***
## Logging into your account
If you already have a GitKraken account, click your profile icon in the upper right corner to sign into your account.

Alternatively, navigate to <kbd><strong>File > Sign into a Different Account</strong></kbd>

If you're logging into GitKraken using another account such as [GitHub](/integrations/github#sign-in-with-github), select the GitHub option to authenticate.

If you don't have `GitKraken` yet, [register](https://app.gitkraken.com/register) your account today. Or if you need to manage your paid subscription, click to [manage subscription](https://app.gitkraken.com/register).

## Sign in with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or Google

When navigating to <kbd><strong>File > Sign into a different account</strong></kbd>, you may choose to sign in with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Google:

Should you choose GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, this will open your default browser and authenticate your account. If you are already signed into the site on your browser, GitKraken Client will sign you in using that account.

Once you see the "Success!" message, select `Open GitKraken` to proceed with the login. If however GitKraken Client does not automatically log you in after signing in with one of these services, you may manually enter the Oauth token provided on the success page, to complete the authentication.

Additionally if your Google, GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account has a GitKraken account associated, the app will automatically link the accounts together. 


## Sign in with SSO

If your organization is on the <a href='https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client/pricing' target='_blank'>teams or enterprise plan</a>, an Owner or Admin can enable SSO. Once SSO is enabled you can [sign in](/gitkraken-client/single-sign-on/#logging-in-using-sso).

## FAQ

### Can I use my GitKraken Pro license on more than one computer?

Yes, your GitKraken Pro paid subscription is associated with your email address, not a specific computer. So you can use GitKraken Pro on as many computers as you'd like!

### I just subscribed but I do not see PRO in the lower right corner.

Be sure you are logged in with the same email address registered with your GitKraken Pro subscription. You can check by navigating to <em class='context-menu'><i class="fa fa-bars"> </i>  <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i> Sign into a different account</em>, and then verify that your email is correct.
