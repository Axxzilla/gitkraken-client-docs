## Roles

There are four roles for a GitKraken user within an organization's account. Owners, Admins, and Users all consume a license which allows them to use GitKraken Client. The Billing Contact role does not use a license and is intended only for managing the organization.

* **Owner**: Full use of GitKraken Client. Add or edit users plus access to billing. No one but the owner can transfer ownership.
* **Admin**: Full use of GitKraken Client. Add or edit users plus manage billing.
* **User**: Full use of GitKraken Client. General user.
* **Billing Contact (unlicensed)**: Does not consume a license. Add or edit general users plus manage billing.
